## Steve's Super Fun SLAM Time (ie Slam Toolbox)

Fork on slam_karto. I've renamed since really there's about 5% of the code that's the same, everything else has been restructured or removed entirely. 

## Introduction 

### Solver Plugins

I have generated pluginlib plugins for a few different solvers that people might be interested in. I like to swap them out for benchmarking and make sure its the same code running for all. I have supported Ceres, G2O, SPA, and GTSAM. I wrapped my own Ceres one as well since no one's open-sourced it but I know _certain_ people are using it. 

GTSAM is currently "unsupported" although all the code is there. I was having problems linking against the library. If someone wants to PR a fix, I can add support but I'm done trying. It definitely won't out perform the others.

I have spent a extremely long time working with Ceres to optimize it for creation of massive maps, so unless you feel your application is very unique, I'd use my recommended settings. 

I have commented out G2O to speed up build time as I really don't recommend using it. SPA + Ceres are the way to go here I believe. 

### Tools

Manual loop closure, pausing and resuming SLAM, interspection and modification of the pose graph, synchronous SLAM (no missing laser scans) for online or offline application alike without change, more exposed options, rviz plugin for visual interspection and assisting in mapping

### Rviz Plugin

An rviz plugin is furnished to help with manual loop closures and online / offline mapping. By default interactive mode is off (allowing you to move nodes) as this takes quite a toll on rviz. When you want to move nodes, tick the interactive box, move what you want, and save changes to prompt a manual loop closure. Clear if you made a mistake. When done, exit interactive mode again. 

There's also a tool to help you control online and offline data. You can at any time stop processing new scans or accepting new scans into the queue. this is desirable when you want to allow the package to catch up while the robot sits still or you want to stop processing new scans while you do a manual loop closure / manual "help". If there's more in the queue than you want, you may also clear it.

The interface is shown below.

### Metrics

If you're a weirdo like me and you want to see how I came up with the settings I had, see below.

![ceres_solver_comparison](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14944147/41576505-a6802d76-733c-11e8-8eca-334da2c8bd50.png)

The data sets present solve time vs number of nodes in the pose graph on a large dataset, as that is not open source, but suffice to say that the settings I recommend work well. I think anyone would be hardset in a normal application to exceed or find that another solver type is better (that super low curve on the bottom one, yeah, that's it). Benchmark on a low power 7th gen i7 machine.

### Performance

It can map _very_ large spaces with reasonable CPU and memory consumption. Default settings increase O(N) on number of elements in the pose graph. I recommend from extensive testing to use the SPARSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY solver with Ceres and the SCHUR_JACOBI preconditioner. Using LM at the trust region strategy is comparable to the dogleg subspace strategy, but LM is much better supported so why argue with it. 

You can get away without a loss function if your odometry is good (ie likelihood for outliers is extremely low). If you have an abnormal application, I might recommend a HuberLoss function. All these options and more are available from the ROS parameter server.

## Parameters

On top of ordinary Slam Karto, the following settings and options are exposed to you. My default configuration is given in `config` directory.

`solver_plugin` - The type of nonlinear solver to utilize for karto's scan solver. Options: `solver_plugins::CeresSolver`, `solver_plugins::SpaSolver`, `solver_plugins::G2oSolver`. Default: `solver_plugins::CeresSolver`.

`ceres_linear_solver` - The linear solver for Ceres to use. Options: `SPARSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY`, `SPARSE_SCHUR`, `ITERATIVE_SCHUR`, `CGNR`. Defaults to `SPARSE_NORMAL_CHOLESKY`.

`ceres_preconditioner` - The preconditioner to use with that solver. Options: `JACOBI`, `IDENTITY` (none), `SCHUR_JACOBI`. Defaults to `JACOBI`.

`ceres_trust_strategy` - The trust region strategy. Line searach strategies are not exposed because they perform poorly for this use. Options: `LEVENBERG_MARQUARDT`, `DOGLEG`. Default: `LEVENBERG_MARQUARDT`.

`ceres_dogleg_type` - The dogleg strategy to use if the trust strategy is `DOGLEG`. Options: `TRADITIONAL_DOGLEG`, `SUBSPACE_DOGLEG`. Default: `TRADITIONAL_DOGLEG`

`ceres_loss_function` - The type of loss function to reject outlier measurements. None is equatable to a squared loss. Options: `None`, `HuberLoss`, `CauchyLoss`. Default: `None`.

---

`minimum_time_interval` - Minimum time between scans to add to scan queue. Default 0.5 seconds.

`map_update_interval` - Interval to update the map topic and pose graph visualizations. Default 10 seconds.

All other parameters, see SlamKarto documentation. They're all just the inputs to OpenKarto so that documentation would be identical as well. 

## Installation

ROSDep will take care of Ceres, G2O, and SBA if you are familiar. 

I also have a Snap built for this that's super easy to install if you know snaps, named `slam-toolbox`. Otherwise,

If manual, You'll need to install Ceres [from source instructions here](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html) or `sudo ap-get install libceres-dev`

G2O: `sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-libg2o`

SBA: `sudo ap-get install ros-kinetic-sparse-bundle-adjustment`


Then: add my fork of OpenKarto (i.e. KartoSDK-slam_toolbox) to your workspace. 

Run your catkin build procedure of choice.

You can run via `roslaunch slam_toolbox build_map_w_params.launch
`
